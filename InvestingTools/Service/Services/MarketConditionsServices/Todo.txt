1. Define a model (for example ,this should probably be an objet that has a Good/Bad/Average type and a Title/Summary about why it's that type and the DateTime that the info was gathered)
example :

public class MarketConditionsModel
bool IsGood
string ReasonTitle
string ReasonSummary
DateTime ConditionsDateTime

2. Decide how you'll determine this information, maybe some api exists or initially it could just be manual user input 

3. Alert the user somehow

4. Later we'll use this to stop processing things - we wouldn't want to try and make trades based on our previous assumptions if crazy shit was happening one day.
